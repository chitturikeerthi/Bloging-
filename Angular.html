       <p>Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a TypeScript-based free and open-source single-page web application framework. It is developed by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. The Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Angular is one of the most commonly used web frameworks.
        <h1>Differences between Angular and AngularJS</h1>

        Architecture of an Angular application, services, and dependency injection
        Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS. Unlike AngularJS, Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic. Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding.[8] Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces features such as static typing, generics, and type annotations.
        <h1>Component-Based Architecture</h1>
Angular uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build encapsulated, reusable user interface elements. Each component encapsulates its own HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, making it easier to manage and test individual pieces of an application.[9]

<h1>Data Binding</h1>
Angular supports two-way data binding, which synchronizes data between the model and the view. This ensures that any changes in the view are automatically reflected in the model and vice versa.

<h1>Dependency Injection</h1>
Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easier to manage and inject dependencies into components and services. This promotes modularity and easier testing.

<h1>Directives</h1>
Angular extends HTML with additional attributes called directives. Directives offer functionality to change the behavior or appearance of DOM elements.

<h1>Routing</h1>
Angular includes a router that allows developers to define and manage application states and navigation paths, making it easier to build single-page applications with complex routing.
