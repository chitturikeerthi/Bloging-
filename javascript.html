        <h1>JavaScript Tutorial</h1>
        JavaScript is the most powerful and versatile web programming language. It is used for making the websites interactive. JavaScript helps us add features like animations, interactive forms and dynamic content to web pages.
        
        In this JavaScript Tutorial, weâ€™ll learn all the basics to advanced topics and concepts of JavaScript. This JavaScript tutorial includes operators, control flow, functions, objects, Asynchronous JavaScript, Events, DOM manipulation, OOPs, Closures, Event loops etc.
        
       <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
        JavaScript is a programming language used for creating dynamic content on websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform and single-threaded programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility. It is a commonly used programming language to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications. It is easy to learn.
        <h1>Examples of scripted behavior</h1>
1) Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.<br>
2) Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.<br>
3) Playing browser games.<br>
4) Controlling the playback of streaming media.<br>
5) Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.<br>
6) Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.<br>
7) Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.<br>
8) Redirecting a user to another page.<br>
9) Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.
<h1>Weakly typed</h1>
Main article: Weakly typed
JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.

The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator
The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number
Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number
Values are cast to strings like the following:

Strings are left as-is
Numbers are converted to their string representation
Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,)
Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object
Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively.

JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.      
Often also mentioned is {} + [] resulting in 0 (number). This is misleading: the {} is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary + operator. If the expression is wrapped in parentheses - ({} + []) - the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is "[object Object]" as expected.
