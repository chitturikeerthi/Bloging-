        <h1>What is CSS Responsive Web Design?</h1>
CSS Responsive Web design is a method of developing web properties that allow design and code to respond to the device’s screen size. It gives you the best viewing experience, whether you’re looking at a 6 inch android mobile, your iPad mini or a 42-inch display.
<h1>Why is Responsive Design So important?</h1>
Here are a few reasons why CSS responsive web design is important -

<h2>1) Device-Independent Rendering</h2>
This is the most important advantage of responsive design. With so many kinds of devices in use now, there is no uniform standard of size, shape, or display parameters across devices. This is where responsive design comes into play, as it makes devices optimal in their firmware environments.

<h2>2) Usage Experience</h2>
A responsive website will lead to a more robust user experience. The number of time a user spends on your site may be a key factor that indicates the quality of the user experience. If they find it difficult to navigate or use your website because they're forced to continuously pinch and center, they'll not be your website. And if your website scales and reacts to the change in screen size, visitors won’t have trouble accessing menu options, links, buttons, or filling out forms. As a result, the user experience will be way better and so they're going to spend significantly more time on your site.

<h2>3) A Mobile-First Approach to Responsive Web Design</h2>
The Mobile-first approach means to design the mobile website first and dealing up to the desktop version. There are a variety of reasons why this approach is effective and preferred.

A mobile website is more complex to style, so it’s practical and more efficient for the first focus to fix the mobile design.
It’s easier to rescale the mobile version than it's to scale down the desktop version.
Setting the Viewport
Pages optimized for a variety of devices must include a meta viewport tag in the document's head. Add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:

<h1>Responsive Images</h1>
Images that can be scaled to fit in size are known as responsive images.

How to Make Image Responsive?
By Using the Width Property
Set the width to 100% to make the image responsive and scale up and down.
<h1>What is Media Query?</h1>
According to the MDN, the CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify.

<br><br>Syntax:<br>
@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {<br>

  /* CSS rules go here */<br>

}<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

Responsive design is a concept that, when implemented correctly, can improve the user experience. It does not completely solve it for every user, device, and platform. You will need to constantly improvise with new devices, resolutions, and technologies to improve the user experience in the coming years.
