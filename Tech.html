        A web development stack consists of various best frameworks for web development, front end programming languages, back end programming languages, servers, and development tools that help to create web applications.

However, the web stack technologies are responsible for the seamless website or web app execution you are pursuing to read this article.

And if we talk in a spiritual way, it connects both the body (code) and soul (execution) together for engaging web application development. Isn’t it spiritual? Oh, yea!

Web stack is also known as a Solution Stack, Data Ecosystem, and Technology Infrastructure.
<h1>What are the Leading Web Stack Technologies in 2024?</h1>
As we step into 2024, MEAN stack and MERN stack development, along with MEVN continue to be among the top web stack technologies. These front-end or client-side technologies lead the race because of their exceptional flexibility and extensive community support.

They also possess great ability to deliver desired user experiences. What next follows is the PERN under server-side or back-end technologies; and LEAN from the Database tier.

As we stated the leading web stack technologies in 2024, you should wisely choose the suitable technology stack for your project. However, while picking the right stack, you should be aware of the following things:

Select the popular tech stack for web development that matches the top software development trends.
Choose the suitable web stack technologies that have huge community support.
The stack must be aligned with the industry standards and easy to adapt.
Read on to know more of the latest web development tech stacks that will be in great demand in 2024.
<h1>Front End Technologies or Client-Side Technology Stacks</h1>
Generally, a web application consists of two major sides. The user can see one side of the web app and is responsible for the UI element. At the same time, the other side determines the user experience.

The side which is utilized by users to communicate with the application constructs the front end. The front end technologies consist of various programming languages like CSS, Java, HTML, and many more.

Let’s understand all front end programming languages now.

<h2>CSS</h2>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a template language in charge of HTML content’s visual appearance. CSS development helps you develop web applications that are eye-catching across devices. Also, it functions efficiently with JavaScript and HTML5.

<h2>HTML</h2>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a programming language used to display the construction of data given on the page. It leverages the most recent version of HTML – HTML5, which offers a feature-rich toolkit, components, and qualities to make web applications more effective. The prime advantage you can leverage using HTML5 is sound and video support, which was a missing factor in previous versions of HTML.

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript is considered one of the primary front end technologies to build a web application’s front end. JavaScript offers various tools, libraries, and top frameworks for web development.

In addition, JavaScript also enhances complex web animation, which significantly adds a positive approach to the client experience.

<h1>Back End Technologies or Server-Side Technology Stacks</h1>
The working functionality of the application based on the user interaction is primarily the back end or server-side. However, different technologies are accountable for creating user accessibility, known as back end technologies stacks.

Back end technologies consist of various servers, libraries, database management systems, back end programming languages and many other components. These back end stacks are listed below:

Programming Languages: Programming languages are used to create the logic of the web application. The code interfaces the web to a data set. Python, PHP, and JavaScript are a few back end programming languages.

Frameworks: Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails are the popular frameworks. They support applications dependent on a single programming language.

Web Servers: Back end servers fulfil the customer demands. Nginx, Apache, and Internet Information Server (IIS) are popular web servers.
<h1>Databases</h1>
A database is a collection of structured data or information stored electronically in a computer system. It is controlled by a Database Management System (DBMS). Databases are used to store, manage, maintain and access any type of data.
